    resonance

    i couldn't rhyme much,
    i was out of my words,
    i thought i'd write a banger,
    cuz it's one of my quirks.

    it's not about the rhyme,
    it's not about the flow,
    it's about the resonance,
    the connection that we know.

    so here's to you,
    on this special day,
    may our resonance echo,
    in every word we say.

    and so when you read
    all the translated words,
    i think the resonance...
    still works.
